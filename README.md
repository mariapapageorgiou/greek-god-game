## About the "Greek God Game" Idea

The Greek God Game idea was inspired from my greek heritage and love of history and greek mythology. The purpose of the website is to entertain online users and gamers while providing basic information about the 12 greek gods.

I decided to include Poseidon, Hermes, Zeus, Ares, Apollo, Hera, Athena, Demeter, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hades, and Hephaestus as the 12 gods (there are 2 more that can be included, Hestia and Dionysus).

This is the second of five Portfolio Projects that must be completed in order to obtain the Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications) from Code Institute.
