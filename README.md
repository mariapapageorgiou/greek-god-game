## About the "Greek God Game" Idea

The Greek God Game idea was inspired from my greek heritage and love of history and greek mythology. The purpose of the website is to entertain online users and gamers while providing basic information about the 12 greek gods.

I decided to include Poseidon, Hermes, Zeus, Ares, Apollo, Hera, Athena, Demeter, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hades, and Hephaestus as the 12 gods (there are 2 more that can be included, Hestia and Dionysus).

This is the second of five Portfolio Projects that must be completed in order to obtain the Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications) from Code Institute.

- Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub
- Implement Front-End interactivity, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries or frameworks

## Issues 

During the development process, the following issues were successfully corrected:

**Timer Function** 
- While developing the timer functionality, there were a few issues. Material was found and incorporated from [Codepen](https://codepen.io/joshua-golub/pen/LYYKrKg "Link to CodePen solution") and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-countdown-timer/ "Link to freeCodeCamp solution")
- The restart message was shown while the final result was shown. For the stop functionality to work properly and hide the elements required, Michael from tutor assistance was able to assist with the bug.

**Footer**
- After different positiong, use of margins, height, and padding, and no use of Bootstrap, the footer is not properly positioned at the end of each screen size as expected.
